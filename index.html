<h2>Method</h2>
<p>Special Equipment: cookie cutters
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Using the cookie cutters, cut out different shapes in the bread and spread them with butter. Arrange them on a cookie sheet and bake until the bread is toasted, about 3 to 5 minutes.
Break the eggs into medium bowl by lightly tapping the egg against the counter. Push gently into the crack with your thumbs and pull the 2 sides of the shell apart. Throw out the shells. Add a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper and 2 to 3 drops of blue food coloring to the eggs to make the desired green color. Whisk the eggs until they are completely mixed together.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Make sure your adult helper is nearby. Add the ham and cook it until it begins to brown a little, about 3 minutes. Stir it with the wooden spoon to keep it from sticking. Pour the eggs right on top of the ham. Don't stir until the eggs have begun to set, about 2 minutes. Use a spatula to fold the cooked eggs over as they cook. Chop up the eggs with the tip of the spatula. Remove the eggs to small plates as soon as they are done and serve with your different shaped toasts.</p>
